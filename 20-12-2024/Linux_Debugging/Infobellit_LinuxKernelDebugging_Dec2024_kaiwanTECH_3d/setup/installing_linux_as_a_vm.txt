**SETTING UP A VIRTUAL MACHINE using VirtualBox**

    1. Any recent Debian-style Linux distro will be required, typically being
       run as a (guest) Virtual Machine (VM) on a Windows host
       Preferred guest OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
        i. Conveniently, you can download a prebuilt x86_64 Ubuntu 20.04.4
           (as well as others) Linux image at OSBoxes here:https://www.osboxes.org/.
           It even comes with the guest additions ready to install. 
           The default username/password is osboxes/osboxes.org. 
          
    2. Hypervisor: prefer VirtualBox 6.x (Windows/Linux/MacOS host is fine):

    Participants should have the Linux VM installed and running before the course begins:
